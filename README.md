Hello. My name is Olga. 
I'm new to this. 
I have been participating in various projects for a long time and helping the development of blockchain technologies both in the technical part and in the marketing.
Now one project pushed me to create a Github and now I will move on with you. 
I hope I will help with my presence, I am ready to learn and help!

As I move forward, I will add information about myself.
